# coffee-barista
This program is a simple interaction between you and a coffee barista .
When you run the program the barista generates their menu. You are then prompted for input from the console. 
The barista wants to know what items you would like to order. The script comes to it's conclusion after you have finished
ordering and reads back your order. This is a work-in-progress.
